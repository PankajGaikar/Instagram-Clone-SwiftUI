# Instagram-SwiftUI
Instagram-SwiftUI is a project that attempts to make a clone of the Instagram app using SwiftUI. The primary goal of this project is to replicate the user interface (UI) of Instagram, focusing on visual elements rather than functional implementation. I am thinking if I should add functionality to this.

# Implemented screens

- Search âœ…

- Activity âœ…

# Project Scope and Future Plans
- Functionality ðŸ”œ
- Messages ðŸ”œ

Currently, the project's scope is centered around replicating the UI of Instagram. Functional features such as posting, messaging, and user interactions are not yet implemented. However, plans may include adding functionality for features like Messages and refining the UI design to enhance user experience.
